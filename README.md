## Supabase Setup

### ‚úÖ Database Setup (IMPLEMENTED)

The database has been set up with Supabase MCP:

- **Table:** `legal_reports` (created with all required columns)
- **Indexes:** Created for efficient querying by date, type, urgency, status, language
- **RLS Policies:** Configured for anonymous submissions and authenticated admin access

### ‚úÖ Environment Configured (IMPLEMENTED)

All HTML files now use real Supabase credentials:

```javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://ooqxmwnzpurkiusbynnx.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'eyJhbGci...'; // Real key configured
```

The `supabase-config.js` file contains the centralized configuration.
